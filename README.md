# Abaqus_FEA_Fire_Material_Concrete

This Python script is designed to calculate various mechanical properties of concrete at different temperatures. It computes parameters such as yield stress, inelastic strain, cracking strain, and elastic modulus under varying conditions of temperature. The data is presented in tabular format and exported to an Excel file for further analysis.

## Introduction

This script utilizes NumPy and Pandas libraries to perform calculations related to the mechanical behavior of concrete subjected to different temperatures. The main parameters considered include compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic factor, and Poisson's ratio. By inputting these parameters, the script generates data frames containing information on yield stress, inelastic strain, cracking strain, and elastic modulus across a range of temperatures.

## Installation

To run this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the NumPy and Pandas libraries. You can install these dependencies using pip:
